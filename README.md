# Computer-Networking assignment
# Project on simulating conditions that can affect data transfer and algorithms to overcome
# Instructions to Run program:
# -Download all associated files
# -Comment/Uncomment send data parameters in RDT_main or create own data to send
# -Run debugger in Python 3.7
# -Enable/Disable flags in RDT for different scenarios i.e. packet dropping (all enabled by default)
# ***Note: I do not take credit for writing the simulations in RDT_main, Unreliable, or segment. My goal was to implement the algorithms in RDT_layer to overcome 
#          these obstacles***
